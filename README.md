__Download & Installation__

Head over the the [releases][] page and choose the latest release
matching your operating system and Cinema 4D version. Extract the
downloaded archvie to the Cinema 4D plugins directory and you're done.

> Plugins are usually upwards compatible. An R15 build might work in R17,
> however, if there is also an R16 build, you should assume that the R15
> version will not work in R16 and any newer versions. Native (non-Python)
> plugins are never downwards compatible.

__Languages__

The main language in English. When you downloaded the plugin, you may
find additional downloads for a different language. This download contains
a strings_xx (where xx stands for the language code) which you can place
directly into the plugins "res" folder (where the strings_us folder already
is).
